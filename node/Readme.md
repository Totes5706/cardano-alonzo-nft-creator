# Testnet and Mainnet scripts for starting a node

These two scripts are used to download either the testnet or the mainnet for the Cardano Blockchain. 
You must either be in nix-shell, or have the necessary dependencies to run cardano-node. 

## Testnet Sync Start

```
totinj@penguin:~$ ./start-testnet-node
```

## Mainnet Sync Start

```
totinj@penguin:~$ ./start-mainet-node
```
